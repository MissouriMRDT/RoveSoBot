# RoveSoBot

Discord bot for the Mars Rover Design Team's Discord server

## Running

Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and place your bot's token in the `token` field and the client ID in the `clientID` field of that file.  
The `guildID` is the guild that you use to test the commands and the server that slash commands will be auto-updated on.

Use `yarn start` to compile and run the bot.
